Library Project including compatibility ActionBar.

This can be used by an Android project to provide
access to ActionBar on applications running on API 7+.

There is technically no source, but the src folder is necessary
to ensure that the build system works.  The content is actually
located in libs/android-support-v7-appcompat.jar.
The accompanying resources must also be included in the application.

Ever want to get into competitive Pokemon battling, but didn't know where to start? Ever wanted to even just efficiently play the game and gain knowledge, but it all seemed too overwhelming?

The CompetitiveDex will provide you with the knowledge necessary to start on your journey to be the ultimate Pokemon Master! There is data on Pokemon, moves, abilities, and items. There are also Game Tools and Tutorials for your benefit.

Feel free to email the developer for any potential changes at asundar1130@gmail.com.

Keep in mind that this app is in its alpha stage right now, so there is much more content to be entered.
