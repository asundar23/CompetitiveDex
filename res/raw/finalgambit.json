	"viability": "Final Gambit is a very interesting move, but should be used with faster Pokemon like Accelgor. In addition, having a decent HP stat (Victini, Accelgor, and Staraptor) is a must. Overall, though, it can be used quite well and stop a potential wall or sweeper. It's not too common, but a good move to risk.",
