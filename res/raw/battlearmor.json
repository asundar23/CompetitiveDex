	"summary": "Prevents the opponent from landing a critical hit.",
	"viability": "Critical hits are annoying; they are purely based off luck and can turn a sure win into a horrible loss. That being said, Battle Armor simply isn't a good ability, by virtue of Pok√©mon having access to better ones. Marowak has Rock Head, Kabutops has Swift Swim, Armaldo has Swift Swim, and Drapion has Sniper. Plus, critical hits usually have a 1/16 chance; it's not that high a chance, so itssimply not worth eliminating those.",
