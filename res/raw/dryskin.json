	"summary": "If the weather is rain, the user gains 1/8 of their maximum HP after each turn. Water type moves will heal their HP by 1/4. If the weather is sunny, the user will lose 1/8 of their maximum HP at the end of each turn, and Fire-moves do 1/4 more damage.",
	"viability": "The added weakness to Water is great, since Water is a fairly common attacking type. Dry Skin is best utilized on rain-based team, preferably with a Pokémon with Drizzle. Heliolist, in particular, makes great use of Dry Skin, since it can deal super effective damage on Water-types. Toxicroak, Jynx, and Parasect welcome Dry Skin as well. If you are able to predict a Water-move, it's best to switch in immediately to these Pokémon in order to gain some HP back.",
