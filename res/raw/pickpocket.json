	"summary": "When the opponent makes contact with the user, the user steals the opponent's item. This fails if the user is holding an item or if either Pokémon is behind a Substitute.",
	"viability": "Pickpocket is a terrible version of Magician. For one, almost all Pokémon will be holding an item. The only way this would work is if the user has a one-use item, like a Lum Berry. The other thing is that they have to be able to take a contact move, which the majority of available Pokémon can't, outside Barbaracle. Even so, Barbaracle needs Tough Claws to make it a threat.",
