	"summary": "Restores 1/3 of the user's HP, after the Berry has been consumed. Cheek Pouch activates even if the user steals the Pok√©mon's Berry through Bug Bite, Pluck, or Fling, given that the Berry is actually consumed. Fling and Natural Gift do not trigger Cheek Pouch.",
	"viability": "At best, this is a very gimmicky ability. Dedenne could possibly see some use with it, but even so would be very situational. Bunnelby and Diggersby have a far better ability with Huge Power, so Cheek Pouch should not be run on them.",
