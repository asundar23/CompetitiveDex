	"summary": "Summons Hail for 5 turns (8 if the user is holding a Smooth Rock). If a Pokémon with Snow Warning is sent out at the same time as a Pokémon with a different weather-summoning ability (Drizzle, Drought, or Sand Stream), the Pokémon with the slower Speed will have its weather activated.",
	"viability": "Snow Warning works very similar to Drizzle, and is thus quite as good. Abomasnow and Snover can instantly have a 100% accurate Blizzard instead of having to set up Hail manually.",
