It also will ignore any burn.br /><br /> With Ursaring, deciding between a Toxic or Flame Orb is up to preference. Toxic Orb is good for hit-and-run Pokémon; stay in one turn, two turns tops. Flame Orb is better is the Pokémon will have to be in there for a longer time. It's important to note that Toxic and Flame Orb will have the same residual output after three turns.<br /><br /> <font color='#FFB2B2'><strong>Protect</strong></font> is there to make sure that the desired status from the orb is inflicted upon Ursaring. You don't want to get paralyzed or put to sleep before your Orb activates. <font color='#FFB2B2'><strong>Facade</strong></font> is your main STAB move; <font color='#FFB2B2'><strong>Facade</strong></font> doubles in power, from 70 to 140, when Ursaring is inflicted. Add to that the 1.5x boost from Guts, combined with Ursaring's sky-high Attack, and you have one hard hitter on your team.<br /><br /> The rest of the moves take advantage of Ursaring's great movepool. <font color='#FFB2B2'><strong>Crunch</strong></font> is necessary for Ghost-types, and <font color='#FFB2B2'><strong>Play-Rough</strong></font> can take out Fighting types easily. <font color='#FFB2B2'><strong>Earthquake</strong></font> deals with Steel-types, and <font color='#FFB2B2'><strong>Stone-Edge</strong></font> talkes care of Flying, Bug, Fire, and Ice types. <font color='#FFB2B2'><strong>Close-Combat</strong></font> is also a viable option, but might not be wise for this set since Ursaring is too slow and taking damage with dropped defenses could spell trouble.<br /><br /> It's recommended to go with <font color='#FFB2B2'><strong>Crunch</strong></font> and <font color='#FFB2B2'><strong>Earthquake</strong></font>, but <font color='#FFB2B2'><strong>Play-Rough</strong></font> and <font color='#FFB2B2'><strong>Stone-Edge</strong></font> are fine choIces. If you have necessary support to take out Ghost-types, <font color='#FFB2B2'><strong>Play-Rough</strong></font> is probably the best option, since Fairy-type moves can deal a wide range of damage. Maximize HP in order to get the full bulk out of Ursaring; maxing out the Attack stat and giving it Adamant nature, combined with Guts, gives it a total Attack stat (at level 100) of 591. This is hard enough to break almost any Physical wall.",

It's a hard hitting set, but dealing with it isn't too hard because of its horrendous Speed.<br /><br /> <font color='#9999E6'><strong>Gurdurr</strong></font> is bulky enough, and with Eviolite, can sponge even a <font color='#FFB2B2'><strong>Facade</strong></font> and knock it out with Drain Punch, restoring any HP lost. <font color='#9999E6'><strong>Doublade</strong></font>, also with Eviolite, is another good counter.
