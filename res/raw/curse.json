	If the user is not a Ghost-type, their Attack and Defense stats will raise while its Speed drops.",
	"viability": "Depending on your type, this move has two very different uses. 
	
	For Ghost-types, especially those with the ability to trap the other Pokémon, Curse-sets usually work well. Trevenant is one of the most common Cursers, with the Harvest/Sitrus Berry combination. 
	
	As for non-Ghost types, Pokémon like Snorlax or Steelix can really turn into a great Physical wall, as well as a great Physical wallbreaker. This should be used on already slow Pokémon, though, not on fast sweepers.",
