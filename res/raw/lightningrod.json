	"viability": "Lightning Rod is a wonderful ability, simply due to the abundance of Volt Switch. It works best on Pikachu, Raichu, and Manectric to their great Special Attack. One correct prediction and the Pok√©mon become instant threats. Seaking also gains an immunity to what should be weakness. That's always useful.",
