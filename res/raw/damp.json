	"summary": "Prevents self-destruction, and makes the user immune to Self-Destruct and Explosion. This also prevents Aftermath from doing any damage. It also works against non-adjacent opponents in Triple battles.",
	"viability": "Explosion and Self-Destruct aren't nearly as used because of the changes in the fifth generation, so that alone would make Damp not as useful. Aftermath is a pretty rare sight in battle, so worrying about possible damage is futile. Furthermore, all Pok√©mon that get Damp have better abilities.",
