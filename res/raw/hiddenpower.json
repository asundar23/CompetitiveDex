	"viability": "Hidden Power is what Pokemon use when they are in dire need of a coverage move of that type. For example, Gorebyss doesn't have any good Grass moves, so it needs to run Hidden Power Grass. Roserade needs a Fire move so it runs Hidden power Fire. Roserade, actually, makes great use of it due to its Technician ability, boosting it to a respectable 90 base power. Hidden Power is a good move to have, but should only be used as a last resort.",
