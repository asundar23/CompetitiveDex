	"viability": "Own Tempo is great because of the fact that Lilligant can freely run Petal Dance without having to worry about confusion afterwards. That alone makes it a better version of Outrage. In addition, you're preventing opponents from using moves like Confuse Ray and Swagger, which are very common.",
