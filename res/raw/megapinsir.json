			"setexplanation": "Mega Pinsir is all about attacking. While Bug/Flying is a poor defensive typing, Mega Pinsir has not only the attacking power, but also the Speed and perfect ability: Aerilate. Aerilate turns all Normal-type moves into STAB Flying moves; in addition these moves get a 30% boost.<br /><br />This makes a move like <font color='#FFB2B2'>Quick Attack</font>, normally a Normal-type priority move with 40 Base Power, into a pretty good 78 base power move with priority. This makes for great revenge killing and setting up. Something this can be compared to is <font color='#9999E6'>Aegislash-Blade</font>, who is one of the most popular physical sweepers out there. A +4 Attack <font color='#FFB2B2'>Shadow Sneak</font> does a great amount of damage on most Pokémon; the same goes for<font color='#FFB2B2'> Quick Attack</font>, only it's <i>more</i> powerful.<br /><br /><font color='#FFB2B2'>Swords Dance</font> is necessary because though Pinsir has an amazing Attack stat, it needs that extra punch to make <font color='#FFB2B2'>Quick Attack</font> a truly deadly move. The last two slots are up to preference, and any combination will depend on the support of your team. <font color='#FFB2B2'>Return</font> is good because it's a 102-base power attack (assuming max happiness), and get the STAB + Aerlate boost, making it a 198.9 base power move. That is usually recommended, but there are other available options. <font color='#FFB2B2'>Close Combat</font> will hit Steel types such as <font color='#9999E6'>Bisharp</font> or <font color='#9999E6'>Ferrothorn</font> hard, <font color='#FFB2B2'>Earthquake</font> hits Steel and Fire types hard (especially <font color='#9999E6'>Heatran</font>), and<font color='#FFB2B2'> X-Scissor</font> is another stab that can take care of Psychic and Dark types. Mega Pinsir is truly a sufferer of &quot;4-moveslot syndrome,&quot; which occurs when a Pokémon is limited by the limit of 4 moves per. For what it's worth, though, Mega Pinsir is a very quick attacker, and with great moves and priority, is absolutely deadly.<br /><br />It is vital to remember that if you're going to have Mega Pinsir on your team, his Bug/Flying typing means he's 4x weak to <font color='#FFB2B2'>Stealth Rock</font>. This means that proper team support, in the form of <font color='#FFB2B2'>Defog</font>, <font color='#FFB2B2'>Rapid Spin</font>, and/or <font color='#FFB2B2'>Wish</font>-passing will be to your benefit.",
			"checksandcounters": "Since Mega Pinsir can run a vast array of moves, what it&nbsp;<em>is&nbsp;</em>running will largely influence what its counters are: Almost all Mega Pinsir you will encounter will run <font color='#FFB2B2'>Swords Dance</font> and <font color='#FFB2B2'>Quick Attack</font>, so this section will be largely dependent on what the last two moves are:<br /><br /><br /><font color='#FFB2B2'>Return</font>/<font color='#FFB2B2'>Close Combat</font>
<br /><br /><br /><font color='#9999E6'>Skarmory</font> is the best check&nbsp;<em>if</em> Mega Pinsir has already set up. If it hasn't, Skarmory becomes a full-on counter. <font color='#9999E6'>Aegislash-Shield</font> also hard counters this set due to resisting <font color='#FFB2B2'>Quick Attack</font> and <font color='#FFB2B2'>Return</font>, as well as being immune to <font color='#FFB2B2'>Close Combat</font>. Depending on where Mega Pinsir's Attack stat is, <font color='#9999E6'>Sableye</font> and <font color='#9999E6'>Mega Banette</font> will provide great checks, as they have priority <font color='#FFB2B2'>Will-O-Wisp</font>.<br /><br /><br /><font color='#FFB2B2'>Close</font> <font color='#FFB2B2'>Combat</font>/<font color='#FFB2B2'>Earthquake</font><br /><br /><font color='#9999E6'>Skarmory</font> is still the best check or counter, depending on where Mega Pinsir's Attack stat is. <font color='#9999E6'>Aegislash-Shield</font> is no longer a counter, due to being hit by <font color='#FFB2B2'>Earthquake</font> for super-effective damage. <font color='#9999E6'>Togekiss</font> deals with this combination quite well, especially a Physically-Defensive variant. It quad-resists <font color='#FFB2B2'>Close Combat</font> and is immune to <font color='#FFB2B2'>Earthquake</font>. In this sense, Xatu is a great counter to those two moves, but is susceptible to <font color='#FFB2B2'>Quick Attack.</font> <font color='#9999E6'>Talonflame</font> is another good check; he can fire back with a priority <font color='#FFB2B2'>Brave Bird</font>, which will demolish Mega Pinsir, while switching in on a resisted <font color='#FFB2B2'>Close Combat </font>or <font color='#FFB2B2'>Earthquake</font>.
<br /><br /><br /><font color='#FFB2B2'>Return</font>/<font color='#FFB2B2'>Earthquake</font>
<br /><br /><font color='#9999E6'>Ferrothorn</font> is a pretty good check, and can fire back with a <font color='#FFB2B2'>Gyro Ball</font> or <font color='#FFB2B2'>Thunder Wave</font>. <font color='#9999E6'>Skarmory</font> completely hard counters this combination, though, due to it being immune to <font color='#FFB2B2'>Earthquake</font> and resistant to <font color='#FFB2B2'>Return</font>/<font color='#FFB2B2'>Quick</font> <font color='#FFB2B2'>Attack</font>.",
