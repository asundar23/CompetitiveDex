	"viability": "The problem with the Fang moves are that they don't have good power, but that changes significantly with Strong Jaw. Ice Fang goes from 65 power to 97, which is perfectly acceptable for a Pok√©mon like Tyrantrum. In addition, Crunch becomes a 120 Base Power move, which is even better.",
