	"summary": "Prevents stat reduction caused by another Pokémon's move or ability. This doesn't prevent stat increasing moves such as Swagger, nor does it prevent self-inflicted drops from moves such as Superpower. Clear Body also does not prevent stat loss from a status, such as the Attack drop when burned.",
	"viability": "Since the ability Intimidate is so common, having a Pokémon with Clear Body that's a physical threat is great. Metagross and Klinklang, especially, are really good for this reason. Moves like Memento or Baby-Doll eyes, which are designed to cut down attacking prowess, will be useless.",
