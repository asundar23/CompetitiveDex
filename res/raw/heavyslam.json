It can be 40 base power (target's weight is greater than 1/2 of the user's weight), 60 (1/3 < target's weight <= 1/2), 80 (1/4 < target's weight <= 1/3), 100 (1/5 < target's weight <= 1/4), or 120 (target's weight <= 1/5).",
	"viability": "Heavy Slam is great on Pokemon like Aggron and Mega Aggron due to their bulk. It's a toss up between that and Iron Head (more consistency) but either are fine choices.",
