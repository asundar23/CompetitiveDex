	"viability": "Flash Cannon is a pretty underrated move, and that could be due to Steel not being a common offensive type. With Rock, Ice, and Fairy types being very popular. Flash Cannon can be used as a good coverage move. For Hydreigon, due to its weakness to Ice and 4x weakness to Fairy, Flash Cannon is highly recommended.",
