	"viability": "For fast Pokémon or those with Prankster, Disable is a fantastic move. In fact, Sub-Disable Gengar is one of the most popular strategies, due to Gengar's great speed. This can prevent Pokémon from setting up, sweeping, or even Pursuit-trapping. Though the opponent can predict around it, preventing the opponent from using a certain move can allow an easy revenge kill.",
