	"viability": "As with most gimmicks, this can either end up horribly or game-changing. The issue is that you'll be relying on luck to get the boost you want. Having the evasion boost is probably the best situation, but that is a less than 20% chance. This is commonly seen on Shuckle sets aimed to stall the opponent to death, and with its shallow movepool it can't really hurt to try.",
