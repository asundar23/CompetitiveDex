She's riddled with a terrible defensive typing, which includes a 4x weakness to Stealth Rock, but there aren't many options out there. It's possible to run a Substitute+Defend Order set and make yourself into a mixed wall toxic staller, but it takes a lot of setting up to pull it off. Since there are limited choIces available for Vespiquen, though, one would be advised to run Defend Order on any Vespiquen set.",
