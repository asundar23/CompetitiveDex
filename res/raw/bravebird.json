	"viability": "This is the best Physical-Flying type move out there. The recoil damage isn't too bad, and 120 power with 100% accuracy is perfect. Talonflame, with its Gale Wings ability, is one of the best users of this move. In addition, Blaziken can run this as an additional coverage move, Ho-Oh has an amazing STAB move, and Swellow can utilize its Guts ability to hit hard. Definitely find a spot for this move on your team if you can, because it usually will deal a significant amount of damage.",
