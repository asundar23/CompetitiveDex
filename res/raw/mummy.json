	"viability": "This is a bit situational, but highly effective for Cofagrigus and Yamask. Dark and Ghost-type moves have a lot of contact moves, and to be able to supress another Pok√©mon's Ability can prove to be very valuable. For example, if Azumarill uses Huge Power on a Cofagrigus, it loses its Huge Power ability, rendering it useless until it switches out.",
