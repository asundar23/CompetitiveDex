	"summary": "Allows the user to survive an attack that would normally cause it to faint with 1 HP. The chances of this move successfully working decrease by 50% every consecutive turn. Protects against multi-hitting moves as well.",
	"viability": "While not as common, Endure can accomplish a couple things; first, if an opponent is burned or poisoned, you can ensure more residual damage. Protect is better for that, but if you have a sweeper on your hands, it's often okay to use Endure instead. The second, and more popular way is to equip a Pokemon like Drifblim with Weakness Policy. A super effective move like Knock Off will send it to 1 HP after Endure, and will also raise its Attack and Special Attack. There are a lot of possibilities with Endure, and is definitely worth trying out.",
