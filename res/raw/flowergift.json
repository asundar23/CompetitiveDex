	"viability": "In singles, this is useless, as Grass-moves are better specially than physically, such as Solar Beam. In Doubles and Triple, though, this is an entirely different story. Especially if you have a Pokémon with good physical attack like Shiftry, with Chlorophyll, Flower Gift becomes an absolute must-have.",
