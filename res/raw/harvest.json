	"name":"Harvest",
	"summary": "If the Pokémon has used a Berry, there is a 50% chance of it being restored at the end of each turn. Always activates in sunlight. Berries taken out by Knock Off, Incinerate, or Bug Bite will not activate Harvest.",
	"viability": "Harvest is a great ability, particularly because the Pokémon that have access are pretty bulky. Trevenant can run a great Curse-Harvest set with Sitrus Berry, and Exeggutor and Tropius can both run defensive Harvest-Sitrus sets. The only thing to watch out for is that since Knock Off is so common, and 2 or the 3 main users are weak to Dark, you most likely will have trouble running Harvest.
	
	In addition to Sitrus Berry, you can also use Lum Berry or a type-weakening Berry in order to minimize damage and status conditions.",
