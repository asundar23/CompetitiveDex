	"name":"Contrary",
	"summary": "Causes all stats that are lowered to be inversely raised, and vice versa. This means that if a move lowers your Attack by one stage, it will actually increase by one stage instead. Stats that are Baton Passed are not reversed.",
	"viability": "Contrary is one of the most fun abilities to use. It takes a wild amount of predicting, but the payoff is well worth it. Take a look at Superpower, for example. Spinda and Malamar can both use it, at an insane 120 base-power, actually increasing their Attack and Defense instead of lowering it. Even something like Sticky Web can be very helpful, because your Speed will be actually increased instead of decreased.",
