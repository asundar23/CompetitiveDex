	"viability": "This is Mega Pinsir's aignature ability. It can be very useful for a powerful STAB Quick Attack and Return. All Normal-type moves will become a STAB move, plus enjoy a boost. This makes Quick Attack a total power of 88 before type calculations. That is a great amount of power for a priority move.
	
				This also turns Return from a 102 Base Power move (max happiness), to a whopping 199 total power before type calculations. No recoil like with Brave Bird, plus a bit more power. That makes this ability an instant attraction, and the main reason as to why Mega Pinsir is so great. Its sky-high attack stat, as well, really use this ability to its full potential.",
