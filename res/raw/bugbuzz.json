	"viability": "Bug Buzz was already a very good move, but now it can hit through Substitutes due to its nature as a sound-based move. This makes it even better than it was before, mostly because this prevents opposing Pokémon from setting up inside a Substitute. Volcarona and Genesect are probably the two best Pokémon that run this move, the former with Quiver Dance and the latter with the Download ability. In lower tiers, Vivillon is a very good user of this move with Quiver Dance and Hurricane for extra coverage. Bottom line: this is the best specially-based Bug-type move, and it is worth using.",
