	"viability": "Fairy is one of the best coverages, if not the best, to have. You get super effective damage on Dragon, Dark, and Fighting, all prominent offensive typings. In addition, it helps out Pokémon such as Alakazam and Azelf, who have a weakness to Dark. As for Fairy types, Moonblast is far better, but if it doesn't get it, Dazzling Gleam is a solid backup plan.",
