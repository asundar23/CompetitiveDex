	"viability": "Flare Blitz is the best Fire-type physical move out there. Though there is a considerable recoil, that shouldn't necessarily stop you from using it. High Attack Pokemon like Darmanitan and Entei make great use of it, and have high enough HP stats to handle it. In addition, Emboar with Reckless boosts the power even more. It's absolutely worth using.",
