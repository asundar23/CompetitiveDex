	"viability": "Air Slash is a great move for those who don't want to deal with the unreliable accuracy of non-rain weather Hurricane. The flinch chance is pretty high, so Togekiss with Serene Grace, which doubles the chance of secondary effect, makes great use of this move. The base power isn't incredibly high, but it is respectable enough to run as a good STAB move for specially-based Flying types.",
