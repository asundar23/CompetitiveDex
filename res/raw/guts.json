	"viability": "Guts is amazing, especially with the use of Toxic and Flame Orb. Not having to waste a turn setting up Bulk Up or Swords Dance is very valuable, and allows for hitting hard at a much quicker pace. Heracross and Swellow are some users of Guts that make them the deadly Pok√©mon they are. Heracross can utilize Megahorn and Close Combat at insane power, and Swellow, though not sporting a great Attack stat, can use a Guts-boosted Facade for a lot of damage.
	
	As far as items, use Toxic Orb if you plan on switching out constantly, and Flame if you plan on sweeping.",
