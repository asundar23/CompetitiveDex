	"summary": "Causes Pokémon to eat Berries that are normally eaten at 25% to be eaten at 50%. Has no effect on Berries that aren't triggered by the HP, such as Leppa or Lum Berry.",
	"viability": "Gluttony is great for Pokémon that rely heavily on Berries. Especially with something like Salac Berry, this widens the window of consumption by a lot. This means that instead of having to hope that the user lives with less than 25% HP left, they can have it activated at 50%.",
