	"summary": "One additional PP is deducted when the opponent uses a move.
	
	Outside of battle, if a Pokémon with Pressure leads the party, the chances of finding a higher-level wild Pokémon is increased by 50%.",
	"viability": "Since so many powerful moves only have 5 PP (8 if you have used PP Max or 3 PPUp's), that shortens their lifespan by even longer. Pressure is good in that regards, especially if you have a defensively orientated Pokémon like Spiritomb.",
