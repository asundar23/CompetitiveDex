	"viability": "For the most part, predicting a switch for Sap Sipper can turn the tide of the match. Gaining an immunity, as well as the opporunity to raise one of your stats is pretty valuable. The exception to this is Azumarill, who benefits far more from Huge Power than with Sap Sipper. Otherwise, for Pok√©mon like Miltank, Zebstrika, and Goodra, it all depends on the sets you're running and how you are going to utilize your Attack stat.",
