	"viability": "Dark type moves are pretty common, so it's a fair option. With Terrakion, Virizion (physical variant), and Cobalion, Justified really works due to their resistance to Dark type, then firing back with a powerful Close Combat. Lucario is a similar story, although some people prefer Steadfast. It really depends on the set your Pok√©mon is running, and if the other abilities provided serve their purposes better.",
