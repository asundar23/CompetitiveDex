	"viability": "Solar Power is a double-edged sword, and really only works for Mega Houndoom in a Sun team. First, sun decreases the power of Water moves, so that increases Mega Houndoom's longevity. Second, with such a good Special Attack Mega Houndoom just needs that little boost to start wrecking the opponent's Pok√©mon. Otherwise, Charizard should be holding Mega Stones, Heliolisk should have Dry Skin or Sand Veil, Tropius should have Harvest, and Sunflora should have Chlorophyll.",
